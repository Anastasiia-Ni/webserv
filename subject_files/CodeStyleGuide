Here we need to write our rules for writing code. 
Something like a norminet for the project.

1. All structures and functions are preceded by comments of the format /* bla-bla */ 
   briefly describing what is happening below.

2. Class name format: 
   class HttpRequest 
   {

   };

3. Functions name format: 
   countingVariable()

   bool isDigits(std::string const &str) 
   {
	   return (str.find_first_not_of("0123456789") == std::string::npos);
   }

4. Structures name format:
   typedef struct  s_error {
      ...
   }               t_error;

5. Variables name format: 
   - private or protected: _server
   - public: server

6. Names of structures, variables and functions should reflect the meaning of their content, avoid abbreviations
